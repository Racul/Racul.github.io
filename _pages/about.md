Hello,
My name is Jeongmin Park, and I am an undergraduate student at Seoul National University, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering (Class of 2021). I am also pursuing a double major in Business Administration.

I am particularly interested in **Large Language Models**, **Deep Learning**, and **Building AI Systems for Real-World Problem Solving**. I am developing both theoretical knowledge and practical skills through various projects, coursework, and research experiences.

My research and projects span various domains including natural language processing, medical image reconstruction, and AI benchmarking. I have experience working with deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and Huggingface, and I enjoy tackling challenging problems that require both technical expertise and creative solutions.
